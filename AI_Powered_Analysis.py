            Task:
                Analyze the provided resume text in relation to the job description and generate a **comprehensive, ATS-optimized report** with the following details:

                1. **Relevance Score**: A percentage (0-100%) indicating how closely the resume matches the job description.
                2. **Strengths**: Key areas where the resume aligns well with the job description, including relevant **technical skills, soft skills, industry experience, and project impact**.
                3. **Weaknesses**: Areas where the resume lacks alignment with the job description, including missing qualifications, **outdated technologies, or insufficient quantification of achievements**.
                4. **Suggestions**: Actionable advice to improve the resumeâ€™s alignment, such as **adding metrics (e.g., "Increased efficiency by 20%"), highlighting leadership roles, or improving keyword optimization**.
                5. **Missing Keywords**: Important **ATS-relevant** keywords that are missing or underused, including **technical skills, certifications, and industry-specific terms**.
                6. **Grammar and Writing Quality**: Evaluate clarity, grammar, and **ATS compliance**:
                    - **Grammar Errors**: Identify specific issues (e.g., "Incorrect verb tense in 'Managed projects that was successful.'").
                    - **Clarity Issues**: Highlight vague or repetitive phrasing (e.g., "Avoid phrases like 'responsible for' and replace with action-driven verbs.").
                    - **Professional Tone**: Suggest tone improvements (e.g., "Use impact-driven words like 'orchestrated' instead of 'helped with'.").
                7. **ATS Optimization Tips**: Additional recommendations to **enhance ATS ranking**, including formatting adjustments, keyword placement, and the **use of job-specific action verbs**.
